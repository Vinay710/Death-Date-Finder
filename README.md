The "Death Date Finder" is an ambitious project developed in C programming, aimed at predicting an individual's approximate death date based on their Body Mass Index (BMI) values and smoking habits. The primary objective of this project is to raise awareness about the significance of a healthy lifestyle and its impact on life expectancy.

Key Features:

BMI Calculation: The application allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI, a commonly used metric to assess body composition. By integrating BMI into the prediction model, the project can evaluate the user's body mass index and its correlation with life expectancy.

Smoking Habits Assessment: The "Death Date Finder" also prompts users to provide information about their smoking habits, including frequency and duration of smoking. Smoking is a well-known factor affecting life expectancy, and this data plays a crucial role in generating more accurate predictions.

Data Analysis and Prediction: Using the BMI values and smoking habits data, the application employs advanced statistical algorithms and data analysis techniques to generate personalized predictions. The model takes into account various mortality risk factors associated with BMI and smoking, providing users with a projected estimate of their potential life expectancy.

User-Friendly Interface: The project is designed with a user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use for individuals from various backgrounds. The interactive nature of the application encourages users to engage with the predictions and reflect on their lifestyle choices.

Privacy and Data Security: The "Death Date Finder" prioritizes user privacy and data security. No personal identifying information is collected, and all data provided by users is anonymized and protected through robust encryption methods.

Impact:
The "Death Date Finder" project aims to empower individuals with knowledge about the potential consequences of their lifestyle choices. By raising awareness of the impact of BMI and smoking habits on life expectancy, the application encourages users to make healthier decisions and adopt positive changes in their daily routines. Ultimately, the project strives to contribute to a healthier society and reduce preventable health risks.
